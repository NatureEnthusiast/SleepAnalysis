# SleepAnalysis
A Data Analysis on Sleep and different criteria affecting it.
Objective of the Project: The objective of this project is to analyze various factors affecting sleep quality by examining features such as age, gender, daily steps, calories burned, wake-up time, medication usage, sleep disorders, and others. The goal is to uncover patterns and relationships that can lead to insights on improving sleep quality and understanding the impact of different variables on sleep health.

Conclusion
From the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:
•	Age: Sleep quality decreases as age increases, with a marked decline from ages 22 to 50.
•	Physical Activity: Both daily steps and calories burned are strongly correlated with improved sleep quality.
•	Gender: There are differences in sleep quality between males and females.
•	Wake-up Time: The wake-up time seems to have a moderate impact on sleep quality.
•	Sleep Disorders: The presence of sleep disorders negatively affects sleep quality.
•	Medication Usage: Individuals using medication had varied sleep quality based on their usage patterns.
•	Correlations: The correlation matrix confirmed that physical activity levels, age, and sleep quality are strongly related.
